# UCSC-Academic-Major-Calculator
A program for UCSC Advisors/Students to calculate what 2021-2022 majors students qualify for given the completed class history.

Input: A file of all the classes that have been completed

Output: A file of all the majors the user qualifies to declare in

Possible Outputs?
- Each Major show with a count of classes they need to take (ex./ completed 9/18 courses in major)
- Each major show with all the classes that are used to qualify for it
- Example:/ Biology B.S.: CHEM 1A, PHYS 5A

Purpose of the Program:
It is only to show you what majors you qualify for (in the lower divison department), it is NOT supposed to be used to see if you are on the correct track

- Only lower-division classes will be a part of the program, upper-divison courses can be considered later
- Lower Division classification is any course below <100 in any series
- Data is all collected from the UCSC General Catalog
- Program will be implemented into GitHub Pages using Javascript/Python, Link can be provided to students and
advisors 
- Classes to consider instead should be classes needed to declare, not the rest of the lower-divison classes
or the upper divison classes
- Advanced Results: Presenting what majors you qualify for, as well as how many classes you have left in the major
and how much time you have remaining to declare

Expected User:
First-time Frost having an Undeclared major or wanting to switch out for something else
