# UCSC-Academic-Major-Calculator
A program for UCSC Advisors to calculate what majors students qualify for given the completed class history.

Input: A file of all the classes that have been completed

Output: A file of all the majors the user qualifies to declare in

Possible Outputs?
- Each Major show with a count of classes they need to take (ex./ completed 9/18 courses in major)
- Each major show with all the classes that are used to qualify for it

Purpose of the Program:
It is only to show you what majors you qualify for (in the lower divison department), it is NOT supposed to be used to see if you are on the correct track

Only lower-division classes will be a part of the program, upper-divison courses can be considered later
Lower Division classification is any course below <100 in any series
Data is all collected from the UCSC General Catalog
